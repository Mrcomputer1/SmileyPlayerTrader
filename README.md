Smiley Player Trader was created by Mrcomputer1 for [smileycreations15](https://github.com/smileycreations15)'s Minecraft server. Its purpose is to allow you to right click on a player and see a list of items they can trade.

# Usage
1. Type `/spt add` to add a product to your list
2. Hold the item you want to sell in your hand and type `/spt setproduct <id>` (it will tell you the ID when adding the product).
3. Hold the item you want to get for it in your hand and type `/spt setcost <id>`
4. If you want, you can set another item too with `/spt setcost2 <id>`
5. Enable the product in the list with `/spt enable <id>`
6. To trade with someone, right click them.

# Building
1. You require Spigot 1.15 to be built on your computer before you can build this.
